# gameofluck
A small game on luck. Similar to Battleship

To play the game, run the script startServer.py. It will run the server on your localhost, on the port 8000.

After running the script, ask your friend to join you on the server, where you can play the game.

The rules are simple. You have to select a random cell. It will give you a key. Then your opponent has to chose a cell, which has the same key. The catch is that you dont know what cell has what key. Good Luck!
